# Lexicon

Documentation extensions for Julia.

### Package Exports

  * `@file`
  * `Lexicon`


# Package Reference

```
@file(path :: AbstractString, source :: AbstractString)
```

> Generate static documentation from `source` and write result to provided file `path`.


`path` should be a relative file path and `source` should be a string containing template syntax used to splice in docstrings for objects.

## Template Syntax

`@file` uses handlebars-like syntax to denote content that must be relaced with docstrings from the Julia help system.

*Example:*

```julia
using Lexicon

@file "../foobar.md" "

Some text...

{{foobar}}

... and more text.

"
```

The resulting file `../foobar.md` will contain the text from the second argument with `{{foobar}}` replaced by the contents of whatever docstring `foobar` is associated with.
